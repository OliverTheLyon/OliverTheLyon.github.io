Hello, my name is Oliver A.S. Lyon. I am currently a PhD student at the University of Calgary in the [de Koning lab](http://lab.jasondk.io/).  

 

## My work and research
My areas of interest are primarily focused on how errors propagate, and what we can do with that information. Although that is an abstract description, a more direct description is that my primary PhD work is on developing new [Phylogenetic Analysis tools](https://github.com/dekoning-lab). In phylogenetics errors take the form of mutations, we model the evolutionary pressures on the new mutations to better understand molecular evolution. In another vein I also study [Laboratory Quality Control Schema](https://oliverthelyon.github.io/publication/2023-01-04-2), errors in laboratory medicine have a rippling effect within healthcare. The clinical laboratory provides a peek under the hood for clinicians to examine the current state of a patient's pathophysiology. Errors in clinical results at best are ignored by clinicians, but at worst are misleading to clinicians during diagnosis, monitoring, and screening. 

## My background and history

I received my undergraduate degree in computer science from the [University of Saskatchewan](https://www.usask.ca/) in 2019. During my time at Usask, I worked in the [numerical simulation laboratory ](https://simlab.usask.ca/). This was a time in my life when I worked to develop new numerical analysis tools for solving complex PDE problems. By the time I left Usask I was working in the [bioinformatic laboratory](https://www.cs.usask.ca/research/research-labs/the-bioinformatics-lab.php), I worked developing algorithms for identifying and characterizing repeating structures. I left Usask and did my master's degree at Queenâ€™s University under [Kai Salomaa](https://research.cs.queensu.ca/home/ksalomaa/afl.htm). My research was focused on the computational power of PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), to accomplish this I worked to narrow the bounds of state complexity of PCR based automata. ... The story continues.
