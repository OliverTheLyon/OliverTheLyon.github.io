Hello, my name is Oliver A.S. Lyon. I am currently a PhD student at the University of Calgary in the [de Koning lab](http://lab.jasondk.io/).  

 

## My work and research
My areas of interest are primarily focused on how errors propagate, and what we can do with that information. Although that is an abstract description, my primary focus is on Phylogenetic Analysis where errors take the form of mutations. When we observe mutations, we can model the evolutionary pressures on the new mutations to better understand molecular evolution. In another vein I also study [Laboratory Quality Control Schema](https://oliverthelyon.github.io/publication/2023-01-04-2), errors in laboratory medicine have a rippling effect within healthcare. The clinical laboratory provides a peek under the hood for clinicians to examine the current state of a patient's pathophysiology. Errors in clinical results at best are ignored by clinicians, but at worst are misleading to clinicians during diagnosis, monitoring, and screening.
