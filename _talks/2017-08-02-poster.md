BACKGROUND: In 2016 FDA proposed performance expectations for POCT INR
devices in response to a post market risk analysis of serious clinical and patient selfmonitoring adverse events: 95% of all INR results should fall within ±0.4 for INR
<2; ± 20% for INR ≥2 to 3.5; ± 20% for INR ≥3.5 to 4.5 and ± 25% for INR ≥4.5.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the clinical risk of warfarin dosing error as a consequence
of POCT INR assay inaccuracy and imprecision at FDA performance goals.
METHOD: INR values (n= 53, 535) were obtained from community adult patients
in the Saskatoon Health Region (SHR). Monte Carlo simulation models were used to
assess the influence of analytical bias and imprecision on INR values by evaluating
the fraction of warfarin-dose-categories according to the SHR algorithm that were
unchanged or changed by ≥1, ≥2 or ≥3 dose categories. RESULTS: Simulations
used a bias of ±0.4 to ±0.8 combined with 3% imprecision and predicted that 45%
to 75% of results would have ≥1 category warfarin dosing error, and 1% to 18% of
results would have ≥2 category errors. If INR imprecision was increased to 10%, then
the model predicted that 45% to 75% of results continue with ≥1 category warfarin
dose error but the fraction with ≥2 category error would increase to 2% to 24%.
CONCLUSIONS: Simulation models demonstrated the extent of one category and
two category treatment errors for POCT INR assays is highly dependent on method
bias and only partially affected by method imprecision ≤10%.
