In this thesis, we consider the nondeterministic state complexity of PCR-inspired
(polymerase chain reaction) operations. Site-directed operations are used to formally
describe the behavior of certain DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) editing methods which
need to identify a subsequence in a host DNA strand prior to editing. These operations
can be considered as language operations acting to match patterns between two sets
of strings.
The site-directed insertion and deletion operations, insert or delete into a host
string based on a directing string. The directing string must have a non-empty outfix
that matches a substring in the host before operating. Prefix and suffix directed insertion are similar to site-directed insertion except, instead of matching a non-empty
outfix, a non-empty prefix or suffix is matched before insertion. We consider the nondeterministic state complexity of site-directed insertion and deletion. Constructing a
nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) for the operation provides an upper bound
for the state complexity of the operation. Our construction improves the earlier upper bound in the literature. Existing literature did not give lower bounds for the
nondeterministic state complexity of site-directed insertion and deletion. Using the
fooling set method we establish lower bounds that are fairly close to the upper bound,
albeit the lower bound is not tight
